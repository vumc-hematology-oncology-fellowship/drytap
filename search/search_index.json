This fluid is constantly reabsorbed by lymphatics. An imbalance in the system will result in accumulation. Some examples: Increased influx: increased filtration from the capillaries from high intravascular hydrostatic pressure (i.e., heart failure, renal failure) or low intravascular oncotic pressure Other liquid entry into the pleural space through anatomic deficits: CSF , chyle, urine, blood, ascites (the diaphragm is naturally porous) Decreased efflux: obstruction of the parietal pleural stoma (from protein or cellular debris in exudative pleural effusions) Increased systemic venous pressure (lymphatic system drains into the systemic venous circulation so high venous pressure prevents lymphatics from draining appropriately) Evaluation \u00b6 Imaging \u00b6 CXR : lateral decubitus position (if effusion moves with gravity, suggests free flowing) Ultrasound: assess size, location, loculations (fibrinous septations which may prevent simple drainage) CT Chest with contrast (not always indicated; helpful to eval septations) Thoracentesis (see Procedures section ) \u00b6 Will it change management? If septated or empyema, consider pulm consult for chest tube. Orders: Always: Pleural LDH , protein, cell count/diff, culture Don\u2019t forget serum LDH & protein!

Make sure the context for the \"Handoff\" section that opens to the right is \"Oncology.\" (Handoffs are context specific in Epic, so if you write them in e.g. \"Internal Medicine,\" they won't show up unless you switch to that context. This is a feature, not a bug, as multiple services can maintain different to-dos, etc., without cluttering or clobbering the others.) Add a synopsis to the \"Synopsis\" section, and any outstanding to-do items to the \"To do\" section. Pro Tip for To-Dos Add the column \"To Do - My Svc.\" to your facesheet (\"Patient Lists\" page). If you use a consistent method for writing to-dos, e.g. \"[ ] do the thing\", \"[x] ntd\", you can sort by that column to bring your undone to-do's together.
